			<h1>Are you looking to invest in a hi-tech startup?</h1>
			<p>                We are a team of professionals, with many years experience of research and development in the most advanced areas of science. The idea for our project was originally suggested more than 10 years ago. Since then, we worked on proving the concept and verifying the algorithm on toy applications. We demonstrated the advantages of our algorithm, and now we are keen to use it in a real application with a commercial potential.			</p>
			<p>                The project is still in a concept stage. Although the algorithm is             
				We estimate the following stages of development. First stage - the algorithm needs to be polished, optimised and tested. This stage may require from 2 to 4 years of development. The result of the first stage should be a working artificial intelligence engine, which is universal in terms of potential applications.   
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second stage an application prototype needs to be carefully selected, which would satisfy an optimal investment strategy - it should be sufficiently simple to minimise the development time, yet sophisticated enough to become a significant leap, which would place us in a favourable position in the market. A proper market research may be required. This stage should be relatively short - a few months up to a year.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last stage will be an application development, learning, calibration, testing and finally - marketing. Depending on the application, this stage might take from one to a few years. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, the overall development time - from the concept to the product, may take from 3 to 6 years for a team of 3 to 10 people. We realise that this is going to be a risky investment, yet we hope that the chance of a huge win will make this venture 
				investment attractive to you.
