			<h1>Technology</h1>
			<p>
				The market of products based on the Artificial Intelligence family of algorithms is 
				dynamic and very fast growing. The spectrum of applications of the new technology is 
				vast, and any new breakthrough in the technology immediately leads to new products 
				and even whole new market areas.
			</p>
			<p>
				Big companies, such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, etc. are investing a lot of 
				time and resources into the development of AI technologies in order to stay on top 
				and get the biggest part of the new markets. The fastest growing areas of AI applications 
				include: search, translation, recommender systems, expert systems, algorithmic trading, 
				robotics and autonomous systems, self-driving cars, fraud detection, terrorism prediction, etc. 
				The technologies and related markets are booming despite the overall economic slowdown.
			</p>
			<p>
				However what may look like a revolution, is not always based on the revolutionary technologies. 
				Significant success of the Intelligent (Machine Learning) algorithms in the recent years is 
				to the large extent due to the rapidly growing computational power of the modern computers. 
				Programs can handle even bigger amounts of data and process them faster. 
				But faster computation doesn’t necessarily mean higher degree of intelligence. 
				There are some principal limitations of the modern ML algorithms, 
				which will make a qualitative leap hardly possible in the nearest time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Everybody who uses from time to time google translation tool, could not help been 
				impressed how significantly has the quality of translation improved in the recent years. 
				Nearly every day translation becomes smarter, the translated text gets closer to the ideal. 
				One may be tempted to extrapolate this trend and to conclude that in a couple of years we 
				won’t be able to tell the difference between human and automatic translation. Yet a deeper 
				thought could question this optimistic view. A translation system uses a statistical analysis 
				in order to learn most probable combinations of words based on their occurrences in texts, 
				as well as most common correspondences between those combinations in different languages 
				based on the statistics available from different examples of translation. There must be 
				hundreds of thousands of words in a modern language and many more firm combinations, 
				phrases and other predefined sequences of words in a sentence. This is what an artificial 
				neural network learns to recognise and to use for translation. But we understand that a truly 
				good translation can only be based on the understanding of meaning of words. This means, one 
				should teach the system to billions of different objects, concepts, notions, phenomena 
				describing our world, and a combinatorial number of possible relations between different objects. 
				We humans, know the meaning of most of the objects we are using in our speech since we learn 
				them from many different sources, and despite one may think otherwise, most of these sources 
				are not written texts. It is hypothetically possible to teach an artificial neural network to 
				all objects surrounding us, but the scale of this task is so enormously huge that it could not 
				be done with modern technologies in the nearest future. This combinatorial divergence can not be 
				compensated even by a fast growing performance of the computers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our approach is based on a number of algorithmic and technological ideas, which introduce a 
				deep modification to the traditional Machine Learning algorithms, and provide a way to overcome 
				some of the limitations due to combinatorial divergence. In a sense it can be called a new 
				generation AI engine. We strongly believe that the new approach should lead to a qualitative 
				leap in the level of intelligence of the AI algorithms, it will allow us to solve much more 
				challenging tasks, putting us in a favourable position in the market. New types of products, 
				new level of reliability and a broader spectrum of solutions will become possible with the 
				new algorithm.

			<h3>Advantages of the new algorithm.</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li>
			    	Major limitations of the modern technologies
					<ul>
					    <li>
				        Requires huge amount of training data (low convergence rate), mostly the data has to be 
				        labelled (too much of human involvement).
						</li>
						<li>
				        Instability: sensitivity to the training data, new training data may affect existing functionality, 
				        new recognition classes require complete re-training.
						</li>
						<li>
				        Implicit nature of the knowledge. Impossible knowledge manipulation, eg. combining the knowledge 
				        from different intelligent agents.
						</li>
						<li>
				        Fast (combinatorial?) growth of the model complexity with the size of the classification problem.
						</li>
						<li>
				        Lack of generosity; non-universal character of algorithms; ad-hoc tailoring of every specific task.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
			    Our approach - key advantages of the technology
					<ul>
					    <li>
				        Explicit knowledge representation.
						</li>
						<li>
				        Knowledge manipulation: merging of knowledge from different intelligent agents.
						</li>
						<li>
				        Model complexity grows linearly with the size of the knowledge; allows virtually unlimited growth.
						</li>
						<li>
				        Logical inference: synthesis of the new higher level knowledge from existing one.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
			    Our approach - key practical advantages
					<ul>
					    <li>
				        Stability: new data can only improve performance, no re-training needed.
							</li>
							<li>
				        Universality: same algorithm used for all applications.
							</li>
							<li>
				        Shorter and simpler development stage (development of concrete applications) due to stability 
				        and universality.
							</li>
							<li>
				        Unlimited growth of the knowledge base - any model can be extended indefinitely without affecting 
				        performance or stability.
							</li>
							<li>
				       		Higher “intelligence” power, more challenging tasks, eg.
				        		<ul>
					            <li>translation by meaning and not by the dictionary;</li>
					            <li>recognition of objects in context (autonomous systems);</li>
					            <li>intelligent decision making, based on common sense, statistics and logical inference.</li>
					            </ul>
							</li>
							<li>
				        Flexibility - the ability to handle abstract concepts, introduce new classes of objects, 
				        concepts and relations dynamically (even “on-the-fly”).
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			The algorithm has a variety of possible applications. In the following part we consider a few example 
			applications, which, as we believe, could be the most attractive from the point of view of a short to 
			mid term investor.

				It's always good to talk to someone who has a good idea to share. AI probably won't help 
				everyone, but for many that will be a stunning experience.
